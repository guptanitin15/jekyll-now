Hi,

Thanks for dropping by!

I am a IT engineer by profession. I help build data driven solutions. I call myself 'Philomath'. 

hI like to read about Poetry, Analytics, Defence technologies, Geo-politics, Foreign Policies & Travelling

I love to explore the world but still, 127.0.0.1 is my favourite place.
