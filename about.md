Hi,

I am an Software engineer by profession based in Gurgaon India. I help build data driven solutions. In my free time, I love to read about variety of subjects and trek in Indian Himalayas.

On academic side, I did my B.Tech as Computer Science Major from Jaipur Engg. College & Research Centre (Jaipur).

I love to explore the world but still, [127.0.0.1] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost) is my favourite place.
