title: New Way of Blogging - Jekyll and Git Pages
---
 
I know I am late to the party but happy to be here. Jekyll is liberating and cool. It was a breeze to install with no hicupps. I chose JekyllNow for now as my theme. I just forked JekyllNow and did some minor changes to suit for my liking. It feels nice to have full control. I initially planned to migrate my old blog from tumblr but faced some issues with posts written in Hindi as it couldn't understand character format. I will look into that some time later.
